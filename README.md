# Python Projects Collection 🐍

A curated collection of beginner‑friendly Python scripts, utilities, and mini‑applications that illustrate core programming concepts. This repository is intended both as a learning resource and a showcase of diverse Python techniques.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository hosts a variety of small to intermediate Python projects across domains such as:

- Games & interactive CLI apps  
- Utilities (image/PDF conversions, file operations)  
- AI / Computer Vision (face recognition, image captioning)  
- Recommendation systems  
- GUI / Monitoring dashboards  

Each project is meant to be modular, easy to understand, and extensible. Feel free to fork, contribute, and expand!
